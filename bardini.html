            I found the <code>bardini</code> reading to be a little boring and <button>difficult</button> to follow at times because there was a lack of excitement about the topic and there was also an abundance of techincal terms and dense <sup>jargon.</sup> <i>What was your favorite part about the reading?</i>

            <b>My favorite part </b> of the reading was when they were <span>explaining</span> all of the elements needed for the <sup>presentation</sup> to happen, such as the time and <strong>money</strong> and manual labor. It also makes me think of how much<sub>easier</sub> pulling off that same <code>technical</code> act would be now.
